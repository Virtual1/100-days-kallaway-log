# 100-days-kallaway-log
The log of my 100 Days Of Code (to keep separate from main repo and let people fork a clean version)

## Log

### Day 1: January 19. Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Started with freeCodeCamp. 1st section, 40 bits done.

**Thoughts:** Was nervous to start. More excited now. Starting to see the possibilities...

**Link to work:** Not sure what to show here, maybe https://www.freecodecamp.com/virtual1

** Time spent:** about 2.5 hours. I want to track this more accurately - will check out apps/addons tomorrow.
