The log of my 100 Days Of Code

## Log

### Day 1: January 19. Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Started with freeCodeCamp. 1st section, 40 bits done.

**Thoughts:** Was nervous to start. More excited now. Starting to see the possibilities...

**Link to work:** Not sure what to show here, maybe https://www.freecodecamp.com/virtual1

** Time spent:** about 2.5 hours. I want to track this more accurately - will check out apps/addons tomorrow.

### Day 2: Janruary 20. Friday

** Today's Progress**: Did up to section 64 of the first course of fcc.
Also did a lot of reading & researching about web dev in general.

### Day 3: January 21. Saturday

** Today's Progress**: Going to do some more fcc, see if I can get up to one of the projects. Really want to make something useful.
Also planning to do something else - learn Markdown. Yip, I don't know markdown.
